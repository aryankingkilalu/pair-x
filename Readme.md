**Pair your WhatsApp number and get a session ID in seconds, ready to plug into [AryanX Ultra](https://github.com/Vinpink2/June-Ultra).**

</div>

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Pairing code login**: no QR scanning, just enter your number and link
- ⚡ **Fast session generation**: the session ID is sent straight to your WhatsApp chat
- 🧩 **Made for AryanX Ultra**: the generated session works directly with the bot
- 🪶 **Lightweight**: minimal dependencies, runs on free-tier hosts
- 🔒 **Private delivery**: your session is sent to you, not displayed publicly
- 🚀 **One-click deploy** on Heroku, Render, and Koyeb

---

## 📖 How It Works

1. Open the session page (your deployed URL).
2. Enter your WhatsApp number with country code, e.g. `2557XXXXXXXX`, with no `+` or spaces.
3. A **pairing code** appears on the page.
4. On your phone, open **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device → Link with phone number instead**.
5. Enter the pairing code.
6. Your **session ID** is sent to your own WhatsApp chat.
7. Copy it and set it as `SESSION_ID` in your JuneX Ultra deployment.

> ⚠️ **Never share your session ID.** Anyone who has it can control your WhatsApp account.

## 🚀 Deploy

Deploy your own session server in one click:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Vinpink2/sessions)

[![Deploy to Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?type=git&repository=github.com/Vinpink2/sessions&branch=main&name=sessions&builder=buildpack&run_command=npm%20start&ports=8000;http;/)

---

## 💻 Run Locally

**Requirements**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or newer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- A WhatsApp account on your phone

**Setup**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinpink2/sessions.git
cd sessions
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

---

## 🖥️ Run on a VPS (PM2)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinpink2/sessions.git
cd sessions
npm install
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "junex-session" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

Put it behind Nginx with HTTPS if you want to use your own domain.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | Port the server listens on | `8000` |

Most hosts set `PORT` automatically. If your host uses a different port, set it there.

---

## 🔌 Using the Session ID with JuneX Ultra

1. Deploy or open your [JuneX Ultra](https://github.com/Vinpink2/June-Ultra) bot.
2. Set the session ID as an environment variable:

   ```env
   SESSION_ID=your_session_id_here
   ```

3. Start the bot. It will connect using your session, with no QR or pairing needed.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Pairing code doesn't work | Use the number format with country code and no `+`. Generate a fresh code and enter it quickly. |
| Session ID not received | Check your WhatsApp chat with yourself ("Message yourself"), and make sure the device is still linked. |
| Bot logs out after linking | Don't link the same session on two servers at once. Generate a new one. |
| `npm install` fails | Update Node.js to 18+, then run `npm install` again. |
| Free host sleeps | Use an uptime pinger, or a VPS for always-on hosting. |

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Treat your session ID like a password.
- Logging out of the linked device in WhatsApp invalidates the session.
- Only use session servers you trust. For full control, deploy your own.
